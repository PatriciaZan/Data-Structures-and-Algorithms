        <h1>Big O Notation</h1>
        <p>helps us understanf how long an algorithm will take to run(time complexity) or how much memory it will need as the amount of data it handles grows(space complexity)</p>

        <p>O(n) -> execution time grows linearly in proportion to the size of the input data(n)</p>

        <p>O(1) -> constant time, execution time remais constant regardless of the input size</p>

        <p>O(n^2) -> execution time grows quadratically with the size of the input data(expensive)</p>

        <p>O(log n) -> grow logarithmically with the size of the input. as the input size grows the time it takes for the algorithm to run encreases slowly</p>
