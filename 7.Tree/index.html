        <h1>Tree</h1>
        <p>A DS Tree -> fundamental gierarchial data structure, a collection of elements(data), called nodes, conected by edges(links).</p>

        <p>Full Tree -> each  node either has no children(leaf node) or exactly two children.</p>

        <p>Perfect Tree -> Full + balance(nodes have same depth/distance from the root) having no gaps at any level.</p>

        <p>Complete Tree -> all levels except possibly the last one are completed filled with nodes. <br>
            Left leaning Last Level -> filled with nodes from the left side as much as possible. Might be empty on the right.
        </p>

        <h2>BST(Binary Search Tree)</h2>
        <p>Organize data in a sorted way. Efficiently search, add, or remove items.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Go LEFT if value < than the current branch</li>
            <li>Go RIGHT if value > than the current branch</li>
        </ul>
